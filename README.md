# Ruby Workshop

Welcome to the Ruby Workshop!

This repository contains the notes from a series of sessions I led to introduce
people to the Ruby programming language. They were given as a part of CWRU's
[Hacker Society](http://hacsoc.org) OpenHacks.

## System Setup

If you are a Linux or Mac user, I highly recommend that you install
[rvm](https://rvm.io). It helps you easily manage having multiple versions of
Ruby on your machine, something that may come in handy down the road. An
alternative is rbenv. I have never personally used rbenv, so you're on your
own getting that one set up.

These sessions were written to Ruby 2.2.0 (but anything in the 2.x.y family
should be fine), so after install rvm, run `rvm install 2.2.0`.

### Windows

If you are a Windows user, and want to use cygwin, the rvm site has a tutorial
to get that set up. Alternatively, there is a
[Ruby installer for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/), but do consider
dual-booting a Linux distribution. There are some easy to follow guides for
that online.
